Obsticles Overcome:
How to make GUI communicate with code. Lots of research.
Figuring which layout to use for GUI and how to position everything.
Problems with ArrayList giving errors.

Unresolved Issues:
No AI, did not have enough time/a little complicated to do it correctly.
We could of made a bigger better code with more tiles and properties but we ran out of time.
Chance/Community Chest could have had more options.
We did have enough time to add Houses/Hotels
No animations.

Mid-Developement Design Changes: No major changes

Lessons Learned:
Learned how to make a GUI.
It is very hard to combine codes, we should of combined them as we went along instead of doing it at the end. 

Contributions:
Nathaniel: Wrote most of Player class and Property class. Helped combined code.
Jackie: Wrote most of the GUI and combined code.
